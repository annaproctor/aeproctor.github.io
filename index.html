            <h2>My name is Anna and I am a writer.</h2>

            <br>

            <p>Currently employed as a Junior Technical Writer in the telecommunications field, I work hard to translate engineering documents and new product features into clear and concise documentation.</p>
            
            <p>Technical writing is a challenging job that allows me to combine my love of language with the fast-paced tech industry. In my current role, I have not only strengthened my writing skills, but developed a wide knowledge base of industry standard software such as Adobe FrameMaker, Madcap Flare, and Jira, just to name a few.</p>
