                My name is Anna Proctor and I currently work as a Junior Technical Writer at a software company called Empirix (recently acquired by Infovista).

                I graduated from the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/" target="_blank">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> with a degree in English and a certification in <a href="https://www.umass.edu/pwtc/" target="_blank">Professional Writing and Technical Communications</a> in 2020. Although I chose to study English because of my passion for literature—specifically focusing on Irish and Victorian studies—I joined the PWTC program during my junior year to learn about technical writing. In this program, I learned a variety of skills from writing user manuals to coding with HTML and CSS. Some examples of the work I did can be found in my portfolio, including a 33-page Microsoft Word user manual, a 24-page mock grant proposal, and this website itself.

                Since October 2020, I have worked for software company called Empirix. My position there has given me the opportunity to apply the writing skills I developed in college to the fast-paced tech industry. My primary responsibility is to maintain a set of customer-facing guides explaining how to install, manage, and use our product. In addition, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with engineers and product managers based around world. Whether I’m writing procedures for new product features or editing internal technical documents written by engineers, I get to learn something new every day. In the past year, my skillset has already grown to include software such as Adobe FrameMaker, Jira, Rancher, Grafana, Microsoft Teams, and Gitlab. I’ve even begun learning basic Linux commands both for documentation purposes and to perform complex installations and upgrades with our product.

                When I’m not working, I enjoy embracing my creativity in the form of knitting, baking, and reading. If you ever need a new hat, the perfect recipe for blueberry lemon scones, or a recommendation for a ghost story (you can never go wrong with M. R. James), you’ve come to the right place.
