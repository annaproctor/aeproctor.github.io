                        This is a 31-page user manual on the program Microsoft Word 365 with the intended audience of law students. I wrote this manual for my Introduction to Software Documentation course in Fall 2019. Through creating this manual I learned how to write modular, task-oriented documentation as well as how to implement basic elements of design.

                        This project is a guide to creating more accessible web content using Microsoft Word and Madcap Flare. For this website, I wrote expanded definitions and brief persuausive articles meant to encourage web content creators to prioritize accessibility in their work. I focused on two major accessibility features: styles and alternate text. I not only described the importance of these features but also provided detailed procedures on how to implement them in the mentioned programs. Besides being a technical writing sample, the website also serves as an example of my familiarity with Madcap Flare.

                        This portfolio is a collection of work created using Adobe InDesign. The four samples within this portfolio include expressive typography, flyers, a book chapter layout, and a magazine spread. They show the progression of my knowledge of InDesign as I began by learning about expresssive typography and worked my way up to the magazine spread.

                        In order to learn about the fundamentals of User Experience research and design, I created this prototype of the academic website Spire using Adobe XD. Spire is the website that the University of Massachusetts Amherst uses for course enrollment, managing finances, posting grades, and much more. The appearance of the website has not been updated in a long time and as it stands many features are confusing and difficult to use. For my project I conducted user testing of Spire with current UMass Amherst students to see what features they felt needed improvement. With this research in mind, I then created a revised prototype of five of the most important pages on Spire.

                        I wrote this 24-page grant proposal for my Introduction to Professional Writing course in Fall 2019. It is a comprehensive proposal for the creation of a youth garden at my former high school. The main idea behind this proposal was to find an interactive way to promote student engagement with nature and environmental studies. For this project I not only learned how to write a grant proposal, but also conducted research into the creation of youth gardens and the benefits of gardening for teenagers.

                        This is an essay from my studies in Victorian literature titled, "The Punishment of Marjorie Lindon in <em>The Beetle</em>." I wrote it for a course called Victorian Imagination in Fall 2019. Within the essay, I analyzed the anti-feminist themes of Richard Marsh's 1897 horror novel <em>The Beetle</em>. Although the novel is about a shapeshifting monster, the real horror is Marsh's prejudice against women, minorities, and people outside of the gender binary. This paper is one of several essays I wrote on feminism and Victorian literature, a subject I remain passionate about.

                        This is an essay titled "Landscape and Violence in Irish Poetry." I wrote this essay in Spring 2019 for my Literature of Ireland course. The essay examines how the poets Eavan Boland and Seamus Heaney look to Ireland's landscape to confront the country's violent history and reconcile its status as a post-colonial nation.
