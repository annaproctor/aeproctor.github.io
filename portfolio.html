                        This is a 31-page user manual on the program Microsoft Word 365 with the intended audience of law students. I wrote this manual for my Introduction to Software Documentation course in Fall 2019. Through creating this manual I learned how to write modular, task-oriented documentation as well as how to implement basic elements of design.

                        This project is a guide to creating more accessible web content using Microsoft Word and Madcap Flare. For this website, I wrote expanded definitions and brief persuausive articles meant to encourage web content creators to prioritize accessibility in their work. I focused on two major accessibility features: styles and alternate text. I not only described the importance of these features but also provided detailed procedures on how to implement them in the mentioned programs. Besides being a technical writing sample, the website also serves as an example of my familiarity with Madcap Flare.

                        This portfolio is a collection of work created using Adobe InDesign. The four samples within this portfolio include flyers, a book chapter layout, and a magazine spread. They show the progression of my knowledge of InDesign.

                        In order to learn about the fundamentals of User Experience research and design, I created this prototype of the academic website Spire using Adobe XD. Spire is the website that the University of Massachusetts Amherst uses for course enrollment, managing finances, posting grades, and much more. The appearance of the website has not been updated in a long time and as it stands many features are confusing and difficult to use. For my project I conducted user testing of Spire with current UMass Amherst students to see what features they felt needed improvement. With this research in mind, I then created a revised prototype of five of the most important pages on Spire.
